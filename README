GOAL

    Find out whether I should use ReactJS for Kabisa assignement, and if so,
    build a prototype.

COMMANDS

    $ npm start

NOTES

    - I changed the link in src/App.js
    - I added double_quotes from https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/double-quotes_2997#term=double%20quotes&page=1&position=1
        to replace the React logo. Need to give credits though.
    - I converted the SVG for the double qoutes to PNG, adding public/double_quotes192.png and public/double_qoutes512.png
    - Changed logo192.png to double_quotes192.png in public/index.html
    - Added credits.

    - Made many more changes, i.e. I found this to be suitable and build the prototype.
