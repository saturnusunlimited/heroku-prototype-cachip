GOAL

	Document development problems that I encountered. 

NOTE

    I did not start this right away, so this is not complete.

PROBLEM 1

        remote:  !     Two different lockfiles found: package-lock.json and yarn.lock
        remote: 
        remote:        Both npm and yarn have created lockfiles for this application,
        remote:        but only one can be used to install dependencies. Installing
        remote:        dependencies using the wrong package manager can result in missing
        remote:        packages or subtle bugs in production.

        remote:          the yarn.lock file.

        remote: !	Push rejected to prototype-heroku-caschip.
        remote: 
        To https://git.heroku.com/prototype-heroku-caschip.git
         ! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
        error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/prototype-heroku-caschip.git'

        SOLUTION

            Choose either yarn or npm, I am going form yarn for no particular reason.

             $ git rm package-lock.json

             Then the rest of the git commands of course to commmit, push, deploy on heroku.

    PROBLEM adding Bootstrap failed

        I followed the instructions from https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap/

            yarn add bootstrap
            Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your src/index.js file:

            import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
            // Put any other imports below so that CSS from your
            // components takes precedence over default styles.

        Got an error from 'yarn start' that babel-loader was missing.

        SOLUTION

            $ yarn install babel-loader

    PROBLEM Still could not use bootstrap <Button>

        SOLUTION

            Turns out I should have added react-bootstrap instead if bootstrap package

            $ yarn remove bootstrap
            $ yarn add react-bootstrap
