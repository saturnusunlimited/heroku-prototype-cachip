GOAL

	Document development problems that I encountered. 

NOTE

    I did not start this right away, so this is not complete.

PROBLEM 1

    $ git push heroku master

        remote: -----> Build failed
        remote:  !     Two different lockfiles found: package-lock.json and yarn.lock
        remote: 
        remote:        Both npm and yarn have created lockfiles for this application,
        remote:        but only one can be used to install dependencies. Installing
        remote:        dependencies using the wrong package manager can result in missing
        remote:        packages or subtle bugs in production.
        remote: 
        remote:        - To use npm to install your application's dependencies please delete
        remote:          the yarn.lock file.
        remote: 
        remote:          $ git rm yarn.lock
        remote: 
        remote:        - To use yarn to install your application's dependences please delete
        remote:          the package-lock.json file.
        remote:

        remote: Verifying deploy...
        remote: 
        remote: !	Push rejected to prototype-heroku-caschip.
        remote: 
        To https://git.heroku.com/prototype-heroku-caschip.git
         ! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
        error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/prototype-heroku-caschip.git'

        SOLUTION

            Choose either yarn or npm, I am going form yarn for no particular reason.

             $ git rm package-lock.json

             Then the rest of the git commands of course to commmit, push, deploy on heroku.

    PROBLEM adding Bootstrap failed

        I followed the instructions from https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-bootstrap/

            yarn add bootstrap
            Import Bootstrap CSS and optionally Bootstrap theme CSS in the beginning of your src/index.js file:

            import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
            // Put any other imports below so that CSS from your
            // components takes precedence over default styles.

        Got an error from 'yarn start' that babel-loader was missing.

        SOLUTION

            $ yarn install babel-loader

    PROBLEM Still could not use bootstrap <Button>

        SOLUTION

            Turns out I should have added react-bootstrap instead next to bootstrap package

            $ yarn add react-bootstrap
            
    PROBLEM <?> in output html

        Encoding of file quotes.json was not in utf-8

    SOLUTION

        $ file -i quotes.json 
        $ iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 quotes.json -o outputfile
        $ mv outputfile quotes.quotes

    PROBLEM git push not working

        After removal of a file with sensitive data in all branches
        git filter-branch --force --index-filter   "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch src/contains_sensitive_data.js" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

        $ git push

            To https://github.com/saturnusunlimited/heroku-prototype-cachip.git
             ! [rejected]        development -> development (non-fast-forward)
            error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/saturnusunlimited/heroku-prototype-cachip.git'
            hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
            hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
            hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
            hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
            aad@aad-Lenovo-ideapad-520S-14IKB:~/visible/solliciteren/Kabisa_pairing/prototype-heroku-caschip/doc (development)
            $ git pull
            From https://github.com/saturnusunlimited/heroku-prototype-cachip
             + 43879c3...a912d3e development -> origin/development  (forced update)
             + 2452644...01a322a master      -> origin/master  (forced update)
            Auto-merging src/tests/quotes-db.spec.js
            CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in src/tests/quotes-db.spec.js
            Auto-merging src/tests/app-quote.spec.js
            CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in src/tests/app-quote.spec.js
            Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

    SOLUTION

        $ git status

            On branch development
            Your branch and 'origin/development' have diverged,
            and have 17 and 16 different commits each, respectively.
              (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

            You have unmerged paths.
              (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
              (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

            Changes to be committed:

                new file:   server.js

            Unmerged paths:
              (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

                both added:      tests/app-quote.spec.js
                both added:      tests/quotes-db.spec.js

        Merge files by hand. Edit the files and you will find two alternative
        versions of some parts of the codes. choose between the alternative pieces
        of code, removing one and keeping the other.  

        $ vim src/tests/app-quote.spec.js
        $ vim src/tests/quotes-db.spec.js

        $ git add --all
        $ git commit -a -m "Fixed merge problem"
        $ git push
